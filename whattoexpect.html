            <h3>Our First Visit</h3>
            <p>Andy's first visit to you begins with the recording of a thorough case history including information about the current complaint/condition and also a background medical history to assess general health.</p>
            <p>He will then examine the site of your pain and your general posture and mobility. As with any medical examination, this may require you to remove some outer items of clothing. The area of pain and the surrounding muscles shall need to be visible e.g. if you have knee pain we shall need to see the knee, thigh and calf and shin. It's therefore recommend to wear loose clothing such as a vest or T-Shirt and a pair of shorts, as this makes examination and treatment much easier.</p>
            <p>NB. You will never be asked to remove any items of underwear, and if you are uncomfortable with removing any particular item of non-underwear clothing please tell us in advance and we will do our best to adapt. You are also very welcome to have a relative or friend present during the whole appointment.</p>
            <p>Andy will then discuss with you his diagnosis, and ensure that you are fully informed of and comfortable with all aspects of the treatment plan</p>
            <p>Treatment then takes place using the appropriate techniques (see <a href="treatments.html">Treatments</a>) and a programme of simple exercises will be prescribed at the end of the session to allow you to continue your recovery between sessions.</p>  
            <h3 id="wir">What I'll Require</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Treatment will take place on a portable treatment table that I bring with me, so it's necessary to have enough space for this and for me to move around it. This will need a space of <em>10ft by 6ft</em> to be clear and available before I arrive.</li>
              <li>If there are any residents parking restrictions outside your home I will need a visitors permit to cover the length of time of the appointment plus loading and unloading my equipment.</li>
              <li>It is useful to have to hand a list of any medications you are currently taking.</li>
              <li>I can currently only accept cash as payment. A wireless card reader for payment is planned in the near future.</li>
            </ul>
