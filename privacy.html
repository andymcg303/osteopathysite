    <h4 class="text-center"><small><strong>PRIVACY NOTICE</strong></small></h4>
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
        (Why we collect your personal data and what we do with it)
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
        When you supply your personal details to this clinic they are stored and
        processed for 4 reasons (the bits in bold are the relevant terms used in
        the <strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong> – ie the
        law):
    </p>
    <p>
        1. We need to collect personal information about your health in order to
        provide you with the best possible treatment. Your requesting treatment and
        our agreement to provide that care constitutes a <strong>contract</strong>.
        You can, of course, refuse to provide the information, but if you were to
        do that we would not be able to provide treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. We have a “<strong>Legitimate Interest</strong>” in collecting that
        information, because without it we couldn’t do our job effectively and
        safely.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. We also think that it is important that we can contact you in order to
        confirm your appointments with us or to update you on matters related to
    your medical care. This again constitutes “    <strong>Legitimate Interest</strong>”, but this time it is your legitimate
        interest.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. Provided we have your <strong>consent</strong>, we may occasionally send
        you general health information in the form of articles, advice or
        newsletters. You may withdraw this consent at any time – just let us know
        by any convenient method.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have a <strong>legal obligation </strong>to retain your records for 8
        years after your most recent appointment (or age 25, if this is longer),
        but after this period you can ask us to delete your records if you wish.
        Otherwise, we will retain your records indefinitely in order that we can
        provide you with the best possible care should you need to see us at some
        future date.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your records are stored:
    </p>
    <p>
        electronically (“in the cloud”). The provider is fully compliant with the
        General Data Protection Regulations. Access to this data is password
        protected, and the passwords are changed regularly.
    </p>
    <p>
        on our computer’s hard disc. This is password-protected, and backed up
        regularly in “the cloud”, see above.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will never share your data with anyone who does not need access without
        your written consent. Only the following people/agencies will have routine
        access to your data:
    </p>
    <p>
        • Your practitioner(s) in order that they can provide you with treatment
    </p>
    <p>
        • Our reception staff, because they organise our practitioners’ diaries,
        and coordinate appointments and reminders (but they do not have access to
        your medical history or sensitive personal information)
    </p>
    <p>
        • Other administrative staff, such as our bookkeeper. Again, administrative
        staff will not have access to your medical notes, just your essential
        contact details.
    </p>
    <p>
        • We also use Mailchimp to coordinate our messages, so your name and email
        address may be saved on their server.
    </p>
    <p>
        From time to time, we may have to employ consultants to perform tasks which
        might give them access to your personal data (but not your medical notes).
        We will ensure that they are fully aware that they must treat that
        information as confidential, and we will ensure that they sign a
        non-disclosure agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
        You have the right to see what personal data of yours we hold, and you can
        also ask us to correct any factual errors. Provided the legal minimum
        period has elapsed, you can also ask us to erase your records.
    </p>
    <p>
        We want you to be absolutely confident that we are treating your personal
        data responsibly, and that we are doing everything we can to make sure that
        the only people who can access that data have a genuine need to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, if you feel that we are mishandling your personal data in some
        way, you have the right to complain. Complaints need to be sent to what is
        referred to in the jargon as the “<strong>Data Controller</strong>”. Here
        are the details you need for that:
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
        If you are not satisfied with our response, then you have the right to
        raise the matter with the Information Commissioner’s Office.
